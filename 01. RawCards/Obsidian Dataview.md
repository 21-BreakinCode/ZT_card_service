# Tips
- **Operator logic**: `-` to exclude
- Query to **specific page**: `[[some page name]]`
# Show
- `List`: show list of specific note
- `Table {field1} {field2}`: show table of metadata field 
# Query Action
- `From`: define the reference of note
- `Task`: searches for all `- []` checkbox 
- `Where`: After choosing which note to use, narrow down further
- `Sort {field} asc/desc`: sort to order the list result and which field to sort by
- `Group by`: gather together results based on the value of the field
