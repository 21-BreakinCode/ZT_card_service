# Logs
> generated by containerized applications

- Access logs by `kubectl logs <type/name>`
- logging solutions for k8s
    - `Fluentd`
    - `Elasitcsearch`
    - `Kibana`
# Metrics
> performance and health of the cluster, nodes, and applications running on the cluster

- administrators can identify performance issues and optimize the cluster for better performance and scalability
- monitor include
    - CPU usage
    - memory usage
    - network usage
    - disk usage
    - API server metrics
    - pod and container metrics
    - cluster-level metrics
- monitoring solutions for k8s
    - `Prmetheus`

    - `Datadog`

# Trace
> [!info] Referecne
> - [Official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-traces/)
> - [Open Tememetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#-opentelemetry-collector)

- monitor flow of request trough different components of the system (tools like `Jaeger` or `Zipkin`)
- `OpenTracing` and `OpenCensus` provide a consistent way of capturing traces across different components and applications running on the cluster
